# CatGenerator
My first python project! A cat generator which can either generate randomized cats or ones based off your name/any word. Must have thonny and py5 to run.

You can follow these installations for easy access https://pypi.org/project/thonny-py5mode/
Afterwards, make sure to go to manage plugins and add py5juypter or else it wont work
